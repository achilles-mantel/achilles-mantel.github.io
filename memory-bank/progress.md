# Progress

## Current Status
- **Phase**: Architecture Refactoring Complete
- **Progress**: 90%
- **Last Updated**: Completed major refactoring to Math Learning App architecture

## What Works
- Basic project structure has been created
- Core JavaScript modules have been implemented:
  - Calculator logic for time calculations
  - Validator for input validation
  - Formatter for time formatting
  - Storage for saving calculation history
  - UI for user interface interactions
- HTML structure for the calculator interface
- CSS styling with child-friendly design
- README documentation
- Bug fixes implemented:
  - Fixed circular dependency in Formatter class
  - Added error handling for local storage unavailability
  - Improved validation for extreme time values
- **Integer Multiplication Exercise Feature**:
  - Generates ten random 3-digit by 3-digit multiplication questions
  - Checks answers when Next button is clicked
  - Shows a summary of results at the end with color-coded feedback
  - Keeps a history of the questions with toggle to show/hide
  - Compatible with phones and tablets
  - Includes sound effects for engagement
- **Integer Division Exercise Feature**:
  - Generates ten random 4-digit by 1-digit division questions
  - Ensures all division problems result in whole number answers (no decimals)
  - Checks answers when Next button is clicked
  - Shows a summary of results at the end with color-coded feedback
  - Keeps a history of the questions with toggle to show/hide
  - Compatible with phones and tablets
  - Reuses sound effect infrastructure from Multiplication Exercise

## What's Left to Build
1. **Testing**:
   - [ ] Unit tests for calculator functions
   - [ ] Integration tests
   - [ ] User testing with target audience
   - [ ] Browser compatibility testing

2. **Enhancements**:
   - [ ] Visual representations of time (clock faces)
   - [ ] Animations to illustrate time concepts
   - [x] Sound effects for engagement (implemented in Multiplication and Division Exercises)
   - [ ] Achievement system for educational progress

3. **Accessibility Improvements**:
   - [ ] Screen reader testing
   - [ ] Keyboard navigation enhancements
   - [ ] Color contrast verification
   - [ ] Focus management improvements

4. **Educational Features**:
   - [ ] Interactive tutorials
   - [ ] Time concept explanations
   - [ ] Practice exercises
   - [ ] Difficulty levels

## Known Issues
- ~~Formatter.formatTimeForChildren() references Calculator class directly, which could cause initialization issues~~ (Fixed)
- ~~No error handling for local storage being unavailable~~ (Fixed)
- ~~Limited validation for extreme time values~~ (Fixed)
- Need to add more comprehensive error handling for edge cases
- Mobile responsiveness could be improved for very small screens

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- Initial project scope defined based on the project brief
- Decided on a client-side only approach for simplicity
- Implemented a modular JavaScript architecture
- Chose to use local storage for persistence without requiring user accounts
- Added child-friendly UI elements and messaging
- Included multiple time format support (HH:MM:SS, MM:SS, SS)
- Implemented robust error handling for local storage and extreme values
- Fixed circular dependencies to improve code stability
- Added Integer Multiplication Exercise as a separate feature to expand educational value
- Implemented sound effects to enhance user engagement
- Enhanced Multiplication Exercise with results summary and improved UX based on user feedback
- Simplified the exercise interface by removing redundant buttons
- Added Integer Division Exercise as a complementary feature to the Multiplication Exercise
- Maintained consistent UI patterns across different exercise types for better user experience
- Designed division problems to always result in whole number answers for appropriate difficulty level

## Lessons Learned
- Modular JavaScript architecture makes the code more maintainable
- Child-friendly error messages require careful wording
- Time calculations have unique challenges (e.g., carrying minutes to hours)
- Local storage provides a simple way to persist data without backend requirements
- Circular dependencies can cause subtle initialization issues
- Handling extreme values is important for preventing performance issues
- Error handling should be comprehensive, especially for browser APIs like localStorage
- Separating features into distinct modules allows for easier expansion
- Sound effects can significantly enhance user engagement in educational applications
- Creating complementary educational features (like multiplication and division exercises) can expand the app's value
- Reusing code patterns and infrastructure across similar features improves development efficiency
- Consistent UI patterns help users quickly adapt to new functionality
- Generating appropriate difficulty level problems is important for educational applications
