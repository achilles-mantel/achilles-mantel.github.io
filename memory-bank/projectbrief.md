# Project Brief

## Overview
Building an educational math application with two main features:
1. A time calculator that performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of time values
2. An integer multiplication exercise for practicing 3-digit by 3-digit multiplication

Both features are implemented in a child-friendly web interface.

## Core Features

### Time Calculator
- Front end to input time values with intuitive interface
- Client-side JavaScript to perform calculations
- Display results in a user-friendly format with emoji indicators
- Support for different time formats (HH:MM:SS, MM:SS, SS)
- Child-friendly error handling for invalid inputs
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- Local storage to save and load previous calculations
- Visual feedback for calculations and errors

### Integer Multiplication Exercise
- Random generation of 3-digit by 3-digit multiplication problems
- Set of 10 questions per exercise session
- Navigation between questions (previous/next)
- Show/hide answer functionality
- Tracking of correct answers
- History of past questions and answers
- Sound effects for user engagement
- Responsive design for various devices

## Implementation Status

### Time Calculator
- ✅ Basic UI with time inputs and operation selection
- ✅ Core calculation logic for all operations
- ✅ Input validation and error handling
- ✅ Result display with formatted output
- ✅ Calculation history with local storage
- ✅ Responsive design for various devices
- ✅ Child-friendly interface with clear visuals
- ❌ Unit tests (planned)
- ❌ Visual time representations (planned)
- ❌ Educational tutorials (planned)

### Integer Multiplication Exercise
- ✅ Random question generation
- ✅ Answer checking functionality
- ✅ Question navigation
- ✅ History tracking

## Target Users
Early childhood educators, parents, and children who need educational math tools.
- Age group: 5-10 years old
- Skill level: Basic understanding of time concepts and multiplication
- Use cases: Homework help, educational games, time management learning, multiplication practice
- User interface: Simple, colorful, and intuitive

## Technical Implementation
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
- **Storage**: Browser LocalStorage API
- **Audio**: Web Audio API for sound effects
- **Architecture**: Modular JavaScript with separation of concerns
- **Deployment**: Static web application, no server required
- **Dependencies**: None (vanilla JavaScript)

## Future Enhancements
- Unit tests for calculator functions and multiplication exercise
- Visual representations of time (clock faces)
- Interactive tutorials for time concepts
- Expand sound effects to the Time Calculator (already implemented in Multiplication Exercise)
- Achievement system for educational progress
- Accessibility improvements for screen readers
- Additional educational exercises beyond multiplication
- Difficulty levels for multiplication exercises
